own life - spouse life - child/grandchild - key employee - anyone would financially impact the policyholder Risk of death \u00b6 variables would impact one's \"risk of death\" in a given year - age and gender - premium goes up with age; male is more expensive than female - personal and family health history - smoking status - employment and income level two ways to quantify the \"risk of death\" - life expectancy - probability of death risk of disability = morbidity FPO rider is for disability insurance, not life Insurance purpose \u00b6 Insurance purpose: - loss of income - loss of a caregiver; eg. a spouse didn't earn income - debt repayment - income taxes; eg. deem disposed of an asset - estate creation; for parents with little money to leave for kids - education funds - legacies; eg. a financial gift to students of a university - charitable giving - business continuation Charitable donation \u00b6 charitable donation - when alive, up to 75% of the current year's income - when diseased, 100% of the current and prior year - non-refundable tax credit is higher for the portion > $200 - so one should claim the entire donation for a family Choose insurance type \u00b6 Temporary vs permanent etc \u00b6 - temporary insurance needs - eg. mortgage, education - permanent needs - join first-to-die - eg. pay off mortgage - join last-to-die - eg. leave benefit to disabled kid - decreasing - eg. mortgage - increasing - eg. tax on capital gain on a cottage which increasing in value - small WL for kids as life insured with GIB - to lock the insurability - assign the policy (transfer ownership) to the kid when adult - GIB allow him to add additional amounts on certain dates and within certain limits with evidence of insurability - small amount \u2192 due to insurable interes Annuity \u00b6 annuity - to address \"risk of living too long\" Creditor proof \u00b6 - a beneficiary other than the policyholder/estate is named - the relationship of the beneficiary to the insured - part of the protected family class (spouse, child, grandchild) - irrevocable beneficiary Riders \u00b6 Waiver of premium for total disability benefit \u00b6 - the premium, the riders and the supplementary benefits be waived - after the applicable waiting period - the supplementary benefit is appropriate if the policyholder also the life insured - if others paying the premium, different rider \"parent/payer waiver benefit\" Renewable or convertible \u00b6 - no policy gain \u2192 no tax consequence - term policy; no cash value, no dividends, no policy loans - the premium will incease each period at predefined rates - renew is automatically upon expiry unless advised not to - the premium can be higher than a brand new policy as no evidience of insurability is required - if the insured is healthy, should compare premium of a brand new and the renewable rate - the old should not be cancelled before new is approved Non-forfeiture options (WL) \u00b6 - CSV (cash surrender value) - when surrender, receive the cash value - cancellation fees - APL (automatic premium loan) - premium is loaned using cash value as collateral - the loan and interests will be deducted from benefit - reduced paid-up insurance - premium is eliminated - face value is reduced - extended term insurance - premium is eliminated - now a term insurance (shorter time), not permanent AD&D \u00b6 - can provide double indemnity - the death is caused by an accident - the deatch must occur with a certain time frame (usually 1 year) - exclusion for AD&D (but basic death benefit will pay) - self-inflicted injury (drug overdose or suicide) - criminal act (drunk driving) - act of war, murder - piloting non-commercial plane (fly a plane for pleasure) GIB (guaranteed insurability benefit) \u00b6 - allow add coverage without evidence of insurability and regardless of health - if added after policy issued, evidence of insurability required - the amount of additions, the maximum age can be exercised is decided by insurer Dread disease accelerated death benefit \u00b6 - similar to stand alone critical illness policy - but the benefit paid out is from the whole coverage, just received faster PUA (paid up additions) \u00b6 - can only be added to a permanent insurance, eg. WL and UL (not sure if UL has it) - for WL, only apply to participating policy - dividend option (not non-forfeiture) - policy dividends is not guaranteed - it is good to show multiple dividend illustrations when discussing dividend options - waiver of premium dividend option - reduce premium only when and if a policy dividends is paid - is standard on disability policy, but an added feature for life Child coverage rider \u00b6 - coverage goes from 15 days to 21 or 25 years - not from birth Others \u00b6 - LTC (long term care) - Term rider Premium = cost of insurance \u00b6 more expensive UL > WL > T-100 Universal life (UL) \u00b6 - calculate NAAR (net amount at risk) - face value = death benefit (when level death benefit option) - LCOI/YRT mortality costing option - premiums paid - accumulated investment component - NAAR (net amount at risk) = death benefit - investment amount - funding - minimally funded premium only cover insurance cost and expenses, no more for investment \u2192 cash value = 0 - maximum funded cash value is as high without failing the exemption test - to increase investment (opposite to decrease) - larger deposit - better investment return - smaller mortality deduction - lower policy expense - mortality charge (deduction) - a fee to compensates the insurer for any losses due to unexpected events eg. a death benefit paid sooner than expected - the average fee about 1.25% per year - mortality charge based on YRT (yearly renewable term) - the mortality charge (cost of insurance) per $1,000 of NAAR - is lower in the early years - more left to invest, the accumulating fund can grow faster - for more sophisticated client (higher risk) - the mortality charge will increase as time goes on - the hope is the growth in investment can reduce NAAR - so to keep the cost manageable - greater short-term policy value - mortality charge based on LCOI (level cost of insurance) - more mortality cost in earlier year, but never increase - less to invest in the beginning - for more conservative investor - looking for longer-term policy value; less chance of lapsing Whole life (WL) \u00b6 - participating is more expensive than non-participating - as it offers potential dividends - limited payment WL - the entire premium being paid over a fewer years - so annual premium is higher - the total premium cost is lower - as the insurer applies the time of value of money principle - the premium can be paid off at known time; eliminates longevity risk - adjustable WL - the premium and coverage only guaranteed a certain of years - after that, premium can be adjusted up or down - depending on actual expense - mortality, expenses, investment return - interest increase will lower premium - premium can't be changed based on things with life-insured - APL (automatic premium loan) is included in a WL policy - missed premiums were loaned with interest - cash value is used as collateral - death benefit is reduced by the loan plus interests - only face value is paid out at death (no adding cash value) Term \u00b6 - Modal factor (also for WL) - annual premium * modal factor = monthly/quarterly/annual payment Full need analysis \u00b6 - calculate money needed - keep percentage of salary / rate of return (net return = after tax) (capitalization of income method) or - calculated by (monthly expense - monthly income) x 12 x years (capital drawdown method) - other money needed - mortgage paid off - funeral expenses - car loan - capital gains tax owned on dispose of property - calculate money available - life insurance benefit (group/personal) - sell house/car/business - liquidate investment - calculate money shortfall - replace net income in perpetuity - net return = gross return x (1 - weighted average tax rate) - insurance required = net annual income / net return - if to replace gross income - insurance = gross income / gross return Tax \u00b6 General \u00b6 - premium is not tax deductible in most of cases - the exception is used to secure a loan for business or investment purpose - death benefit is paid out tax free to the beneficiary - CPP death benefit is taxable - dispose property - tax owing = (capital gain x 50%) x MTR - capital gain = current value - ACB tax upon death - RRSP deemed to be withdrawn and full taxed - unless spouse rollover - CPP/QPP (maximum = $2,500) UL \u00b6 - UL (universal life) = buy term + invest the difference yourself - fail exemption test \u2192 non-exempt forever (after 60 day grace period) - deemed disposition (policy gain = CSV - ACB \u2192 full taxable) - 3 ways to remedy (fix) the failure - increase face amount (coverage) - withdraw money from the accumulating account/cash value - move to side account (=shuttle account); taxable - MTAR (maximum tax actuarial reserve) room - measure the cash value is reasonable to the coverage and length of policy time - when there's room, side account can be transferred back - anti-dump-in rule = the 250% rule - prevent a policyholder from making large lump-sum deposits - after the 7th anniversary on a policy that's minimum funded - beginning on the 10th year and every after - the accumulating fund comparing to 3 years ago - if the increase is > 250%, the rule will apply - ETP (except test policy) is reset to 3 years ago - result in a lower MTAR on the test policy, so harder to pass the exemption test - surrender a policy (after Dec. 2, 1982) - ACB (adjusted cost basis) = Premium paid - NCPI (Net cost of insurance) - Dividends paid - policy gain = CSV (cash surrender value) - ACB - tax owing = policy gain x MTR - full gain is subject to tax; treated like bank interests - proceeds net of tax = CSV - tax owing - surrender (before Dec. 2, 1982) - the ACB is not prorated - only withdraw exceed ACB will result in a policy gain - reducing coverage \u2192 deemed disposition/partial surrender of a policy (after 1982/12/1) - prorate = 1- (new face value / original face value) - prorated policy gain = (CSV - ACB) x prorate - tax liability = prorated policy gain x MTR - dividends paid out WL/UL \u00b6 - exempt vs non-exempt - tax status of income earned with the policy - not the death benefit itself - policy loan - considered a partial disposition of the policy - results in a policy gain and reduce ACB - tax on the amount > ACB - if < ACB, no tax owed, ACB reduced - when repay the loan, can deduct the repayment upto above gain amount - if the repay exceed the gain amount, the remainder will add to ACB - higher ACB will reduce the tax when surrender - when used as a collateral for a loan, the premium can be tax deductable - only the premium associated with the loan amount - only the NCPI (net cost of pure insurance) can be deducted - no investment portion = term insurance Dispose of CCPC \u00b6 - dispose of CCPC (Canadian-controlled private corporation) - $800,000 lifetime capital gains exemption (LCGE) per individual - capital gain = sale proceeds - ACB - unused LCGE - only 50% is taxable - tax owing = taxable capital gain x MTR Calculate benefit \u00b6 WL \u00b6 - benefit = + (face value + interest) + (term addition + interest) - (outstanding loan + interest) - (terminal illness benefit + interest) as it is previously paid Business insurance \u00b6 Different structures \u00b6 advantage/disadvantages on different structures: - cross-purchase agreement vs. share redemption plan - criss-cross insurance vs. business-owned insurance business owned life advantage: - business pay premium instead of each partner - premiums are not tax deductible and paid with after-tax dollars; corporate has lower tax rate in general - compared to criss-cross insurance approach, far simpler than each partner to buy insurance on every other partners Buy-sell agreement \u00b6 buy-sell agreement - the company owns the policy and pays the premiums - when one owner dies, his shares are transferred to his estate - the insurer pays the death benefit (tax free) to the company's CDA (capital dividend account) - other owners pay the deceased owner's estate for his shares with a promissory note - other owners instruct the company to pay them tax-free capital dividend - other owners use dividend to pay off the promissory note Group insurance \u00b6 - probationary period = waiting period - enrolment period = eligibility period - actively-at-work requirement Convert to individual \u00b6 - convert to individual - amount for Quebec: $400,000 - others: $200,000 - without providing proof of insurability - need to convert within 31 days of termination of group coverage What can be controlled by employee \u00b6 - beneficiary designation not controllable: - premium split - co-insurance factor - single deductible amount - membership class Contributory \u00b6 - employee is required to contribute to the premium - the premium is deduct from employee's pay - benefit is tax free - employee can't deduct premium for tax - employer can deduct premium as business expense - non-contributory - employer pay the entire premium Underwriting \u00b6 Rated \u00b6 - rated - excessive alcohol user - risky avocations (hobbies) - frequent travel - major driving convictions - smoker/non-smoker (not rated, just higher premium for smoker) Waiver of premiums \u00b6 - risk of death - underwrite on the life insured - waiver of premium - underwrite on a policyholder (pay the premium) - if he is disabled, the premium is waived MIB/APS \u00b6 - MIB (medical information bureau) report - medical info - hazardous hobbies - adverse driving records - APS (attending physician's statement) Mistakes on policy \u00b6 - void a policy (no fraudulent error, eg. misstatement of age) - life-insured age older than max - still alive - error noticed in 3 years - void in 60 days of notice - deny a claim - during the contestability period (first two years) - material misrepresentation even in the absent of fraud - can't deny when misstatement of ago or gender unless fraud - coverage (benefit) is adjusted by the percentage of paid / correct premium - lying about smoking status is frasudulent material misrepresentation - the claim can be denied even after 2 years contestability period Delivery of policy \u00b6 - in person - sign acknowledgement that no change in insurability - when change in insurability, no delivery - collect the first premium - 10 days free look provision (= right of rescission), start right after delivery Policy illustration \u00b6 - policy illustration - help to understand the policy - for term - only show the premium payable and death benefit each year - for permanent - more complex;

Earum similique, ipsum officia amet blanditiis provident ratione nihil ipsam dolorem repellat.\" --- ### **Introduction** This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I'll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won't cover using CSS to style your theme. We'll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we'll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites. ... about/index.md \u00b6 +++ date = \"2015-08-22\" title = \"Link custom pages\" menu = \"main\" +++ You can add custom pages like this by adding `menu = \"main\"` in the frontmatter: '''toml +++ date = \"2015-08-22\" title = \"About me\" menu = \"main\" +++ ''' This site is just a usual document. Create a new subfolder in `content` and name this document `index.md`. For example, I'm located under `content/about/index.md` to add indicate the subsection `/about` in the URL. But you can also link posts that way without moving them. If no document contains `menu = \"main\"` in the frontmatter the navigation will not be shown.

Earum similique, ipsum officia amet blanditiis provident ratione nihil ipsam dolorem repellat.\" --- ### **Introduction** This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I'll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won't cover using CSS to style your theme. We'll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we'll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites. ...","title":"post/creating-a-new-theme.md"},{"location":"tech/files/staticgen/hugo/#aboutindexmd","text":"+++ date = \"2015-08-22\" title = \"Link custom pages\" menu = \"main\" +++ You can add custom pages like this by adding `menu = \"main\"` in the frontmatter: '''toml +++ date = \"2015-08-22\" title = \"About me\" menu = \"main\" +++ ''' This site is just a usual document. Create a new subfolder in `content` and name this document `index.md`. For example, I'm located under `content/about/index.md` to add indicate the subsection `/about` in the URL. But you can also link posts that way without moving them. If no document contains `menu = \"main\"` in the frontmatter the navigation will not be shown.
